        When Prithvi Narayan Shah had ascended to the throne of Gorkha in the year 3 April 1743 A.D, it was yet a small state. He then started to contemplate the methods to turn Gorkha into a huge and strong state. He went to Varanasi to gain first-hand knowledge about the neighbouring states and about India to the south. During those days, Varanasi was one of the large trade centres of India where people from different places gathered. He met with different types of people and gained valuable understandings regarding the Political and Social conditions of the Indian Sub-Continent. In Varanasi, his father-in-law Abhiman Singh, a Rajput Chief, procured for him some firearms and a quantity of ammunition.</p>
